# Project Documentation.

This repository is mainly intended for my personal documentation purposes. I will be documenting a setup for an online ordering system for a restaurant based on the open source project: '[TastyIgniter](https://tastyigniter.com/)'. The information in these pages is open to everybody and might be a helpful guide to setup and configure a similar solution for your own purpose.

| :exclamation: | The information in  these pages is a solution that WORKS FOR ME! |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|

You might find solutions here that seem unconventional or may be considered plain wrong, in that case I encourage everyone to apply alternatives or corrections as you see fit!

In addition, I will gladly take any input or comments in the [community forum of TastyIgnite](https://forum.tastyigniter.com/).
